# ClinicFlow — Shared Task Ledger / Worklog

> **Purpose (Doc 6 §4.2):** Append-only, versioned, single source of truth for all task assignments and state updates across the build. Every agent reads this before starting and appends a new `---` section after finishing. **Do not overwrite.**

Task ID: PHASE-1
Agent: senior-fullstack-engineer (primary)
Task: Phase 1 — Document consumption + synthesis document (sections a–j) for ClinicFlow multi-tenant B2B SaaS. NO CODE.

Work Log:
- Inventoried project tree; located Next.js 16 + Prisma + SQLite sandbox (`prisma/schema.prisma` provider = sqlite, `db/custom.db`, port 3000 behind Caddy).
- Searched for `docs/` folder and the 7 named playbook documents (Doc 1–7). Result: `docs/` folder and the 7 source documents are NOT present in the project tree. Only `download/README.md` and `skills/**/SKILL.md` exist outside node_modules.
- Confirmed the build directive is itself an instance of the Master Prompt Template (Doc 7 §4 / §5.2) and carries the consolidated specification inline. Treated the directive as the authoritative source for synthesis.
- Loaded (consolidated) all sections enumerated in the Phase 1 reading list: Doc 1 §4/§5/§7/§15/§17; Doc 2 §4/§6/§8; Doc 3 §4–§9; Doc 4 §4–§13; Doc 5 §4–§8; Doc 6 §4–§6; Doc 7 §3.2/§4/§5.2/§7. Mapped each to its source-doc reference inside the synthesis.
- Produced the synthesis document at `docs/synthesis/CLINICFLOW_PHASE1_SYNTHESIS.md` covering all 10 required sections (a)–(j): problem+ICP, functional reqs, non-functional reqs, reference architecture + data model, security (OWASP+HIPAA), testing strategy (incl. cross-tenant isolation + HIPAA tests), scalability & concurrency patterns, multi-database architecture, 4-phase roadmap, unit economics.
- Ran the Phase 1 verification gate as a self-check table inside the synthesis: all 10 sections present; tenant_id+RLS on every tenant-scoped table; cross-tenant isolation tests specified; LTV:CAC 9:1 / gross margin 80% / payback 4mo (all healthy); HIPAA controls (BAAs, PHI logging, AES-256 at rest) specified; NO CODE written.
- Flagged 4 critical environment-vs-spec gaps requiring ADRs before Phase 3 implementation: (1) PostgreSQL RLS → SQLite (no RLS, needs app-layer emulation + isolation tests); (2) missing managed services (Redis, Inngest, Clerk, Stripe, Office Ally, R2, Resend, Twilio, Datadog, Sentry); (3) single-port gateway constraint; (4) tRPC packages not yet installed. These do NOT block Phase 1 (document only) but DO block Phase 3.

Stage Summary:
- Artifact: `docs/synthesis/CLINICFLOW_PHASE1_SYNTHESIS.md` (Phase 1 deliverable, for builder review).
- Gate status: PASS on all 6 Phase-1 gate criteria.
- Decision required from builder: (a) approve synthesis as-is, OR (b) supply the actual 7 source documents to `docs/` so cross-checks against Tables 2/4/5/10/11/12/13/14/15 and the §6.4 idempotency code block can be performed verbatim, OR (c) approve with the 4 ADRs deferred to Phase 2.
- NO code written. Awaiting builder approval to proceed to Phase 2 (Build Planning: atomic task decomposition TASK-001+).
